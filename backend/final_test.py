🔧 SUMMARY OF ALL FIXES APPLIED:

1. ✅ REMOVED spectral_rolloff_mean from feature extraction
   - Commented out spectral_rolloff_85 computation
   - Removed spectral_rolloff_mean from final features
   - Now extracts exactly 60 features to match model training

2. ✅ FIXED JSON serialization errors
   - Added float() conversion for all confidence scores  
   - Added {k: float(v) for k, v in prob_dict.items()} for probabilities
   - All numpy types now converted to native Python types

3. ✅ IMPROVED audio processing
   - Modified main.py to use AudioPreprocessor directly
   - Better duration handling (30 seconds max but smart cropping)
   - Enhanced preprocessing pipeline for better feature quality

4. ✅ ADDED standalone function compatibility
   - Added extract_features_enhanced() function for main.py imports
   - Maintains backward compatibility while using improved AudioPreprocessor

5. ✅ ENHANCED class mappings (already done)
   - Gunshot: 4 classes (Quiet/Silent, Gunshot, Other_Sound, Noise/Disturbance)
   - ESC-50: 50 environmental sound classes
   - iNaturalist: 292+ species classes

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test feature count: Should now extract exactly 60 features
2. Restart server: python main.py
3. Test with audio files: Should work without errors
4. Verify predictions: Should be more accurate with improved processing
