SUMMARY: Fixed Model Manager Class Mappings
==========================================

PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
1. ‚ùå Wrong class mappings - assumed 2 gunshot classes, but models have 4
2. ‚ùå Wrong wildlife mappings - assumed 5 generic classes, but models have 50+ specific classes  
3. ‚ùå Wrong model path - was using ../ml_models instead of ../../ml_models
4. ‚ùå No warning suppression for sklearn version compatibility

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
‚úÖ Updated gunshot_classes to 4 classes: Quiet/Silent, Gunshot, Other_Sound, Noise/Disturbance
‚úÖ Added ESC-50 class mappings (50 environmental sound categories like Dog, Rain, etc.)
‚úÖ Added iNaturalist class mappings (292+ species classes)
‚úÖ Fixed model path from ../ml_models to ../../ml_models
‚úÖ Added warning suppression for sklearn version compatibility
‚úÖ Smart model type detection (ESC-50 vs iNaturalist based on model name)

MODEL LOADING STATUS:
‚úÖ Gunshot SVM model: LOADED
‚úÖ Gunshot XGBoost model: LOADED  
‚úÖ Gunshot scaler: LOADED
‚ö†Ô∏è  Wildlife RF ESC-50: Has dtype compatibility issues (may still work)
‚úÖ Wildlife XGBoost models: LOADING
‚úÖ Wildlife LightGBM models: LOADING

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the server with actual audio files
2. Verify predictions return meaningful class names
3. Check confidence scores across all models
